# Alien Archaeology Game - Learning Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a learning project aimed at developing a 3D first-person alien archaeology game using Unity. As the developer, I am new to both Unity and C# development, so all instructions, code, and guidance should be detailed, explicit, and educational.

## Developer Background
- New to Unity development
- New to C# programming
- Experienced in other programming (TypeScript, functional programming)
- Learning game development concepts from scratch
- Developing on Windows 11 with Visual Studio (not VS Code)

## Communication Guidelines

### When Providing Instructions
- Include detailed step-by-step guidance with explicit UI references
- Explain WHY certain approaches are used, not just HOW
- Highlight Unity-specific concepts and terminology
- Include screenshots or illustrations when possible
- Assume I may need help locating UI elements
- Link to relevant documentation for further learning

### When Providing Code
- Include detailed comments explaining functionality
- Explicitly mention which file each code snippet goes in
- Explain any C# or Unity-specific patterns or idioms
- Break down complex operations into smaller, understandable chunks
- Include explanations of how the code interacts with Unity's systems

## Learning Priorities
1. **Unity Fundamentals**
   - Understanding the Unity Editor interface
   - Working with GameObjects and Components
   - Unity's execution cycle (Awake, Start, Update, etc.)
   - Scene management

2. **C# for Unity**
   - C# syntax and structures within Unity context
   - MonoBehaviour patterns
   - Event systems and callbacks
   - Object-oriented patterns common in Unity

3. **Game Systems**
   - First-person controller implementation
   - Tool usage and interaction systems
   - Terrain modification
   - Inventory and collection mechanics
   - Procedural generation concepts

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Unity-Visual Studio integration
   - Testing and debugging in Unity
   - Version control with Git within Unity projects

## Project Milestones (Learning-Focused)

### Milestone 1: Environment Setup and First Functionality
- Complete development environment setup
- Create first-person controller with basic movement
- Implement simple interaction with objects
- Learn about Unity's physics system

### Milestone 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics
- Implement terrain modification (digging)
- Create basic tool system
- Develop artifact discovery mechanics
- Learn about Unity's prefab system

### Milestone 3: Advanced Systems
- Implement procedural terrain generation
- Create upgrade systems for tools
- Develop inventory and collection system
- Learn about ScriptableObjects and data management

### Milestone 4: Polish and Refinement
- Improve visual feedback
- Add sound effects and basic UI
- Optimize performance
- Learn about Unity's profiling tools

## Development Approach
- Focus on small, achievable chunks of functionality
- Implement one core system at a time
- Test frequently within the Unity Editor
- Document learning discoveries and challenges
- Refactor code as understanding improves

## Assistance Requests
When requesting assistance, I will:
1. Describe what I'm trying to accomplish
2. Share what I've tried so far
3. Include specific error messages if applicable
4. Ask for explanations that further my learning, not just solutions

## Unity Version
- Using Unity 2022.3 LTS
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

This document serves as both a project guide and a reminder that this is primarily a learning journey. The goal is not just to create a game but to understand the concepts, technologies, and development practices involved.
